/**
 * 
Executing the code should display in the console:
    Harry: 4
    Draco: -2
*/


/**
 * Let's break down how this works:
 * ðŸš¨ 1- Privacy through Closure
 * When we define privateScore and name inside the function, they become private
 * They can't be accessed from outside, only through the methods we provide
 * 
 * ðŸš¨ 2- Private Method
 * `changeScoreBy` is only accessible within the class
 * It's used by both rewardStudent and penalizeStudent
 * It can't be called directly from outside
 * 
 * ðŸš¨ 3- Public Interface:
    - The returned object contains four methods that can be called from outside
    - These methods are the only way to interact with the private variables
    - This is known as encapsulation in object-oriented programming
