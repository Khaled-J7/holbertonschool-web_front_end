## Languages for Front-end development

Front-end is the part that is accessible to the user only, It should be self-explanatory and must be user-friendly and designed. so to achieve this we have some basic languages which can be used to create interactive web pages. These are the basic needs for the creation of a web page.

* HTML: It was introduced in 1993 and currently at version HTML5, is a foundational language for creating structured web content. It facilitates the creation of forms, tables, and structured data, essential for input elements and organizing information on web pages. HTML's evolution continues to shape the internet by enabling developers to design interactive and accessible user interfaces across various platforms and devices.
* CSS: CSS, introduced on 17 December 1996 and currently at version CSS3, stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It complements HTML by styling web pages, managing colors, and enabling the creation of responsive designs. CSS empowers web developers to enhance user interfaces, ensuring visually appealing and consistent layouts across different devices and screen sizes.
* JavaScript: ECMAScript, introduced on 4 December 1995 and currently at version ECMAScript 2022, is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded programming language. It enables dynamic changes and event handling in web development, making it essential for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces.

## Front-end Development Frameworks

Frameworks add more features to their respective languages. Frameworks provide extra features, structure, fast reloading, and many more things so that developers can develop a SPA(Single page application) easily. Some of them provide inbuilt functions or pre-defined components so that developer can directly use those in their projects.

* jQuery: Introduced in August 2006 and now at version 3.7.1, is an open-source JavaScript library specializing in DOM manipulation, CSS editing, event handling, AJAX requests, animations, and DOM traversal. It simplifies web development by offering a streamlined approach to interactive web design and client-side scripting, enhancing user interface responsiveness across different web applications.
* React: Introduced in May 2013 and now at version 18.2.0, is a JavaScript UI library designed for building SPAs. It emphasizes component-based development, efficient state management, and utilizes a virtual DOM for fast updates. React simplifies complex UI tasks, promotes code reusability, and is widely used in modern web application development.
* Angular: Introduced on October 20, 2010, and currently at version 17.0.3, is an open-source JavaScript framework by Google that follows the MVC pattern. It is used for building single-page applications (SPAs), ensuring fast page reloads, and providing a modern, modular structure for web development.
* Vue.js: Introduced in February 2014 and currently at version 3.3.0, is a JavaScript framework similar to ReactJS for designing UI layers. It features reactive data binding, a component-based architecture, Vue directives, and Vue Router for navigation, making it ideal for building dynamic and interactive web applications.
* Bootstrap: Introduced in August 2011 and currently at version 5.3.2, is an open-source front-end framework providing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.
